Hiring Manager
Siemens

Respected Sir/Mam,
Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the role of Data Scientist at your company. After reviewing your job description, it is clear that you are looking for a candidate that is extremely familiar with the responsibilities associated with the role, and can perform them confidently. Given these requirements, I am certain that I have the necessary skills to successfully do the job and perform above expectations.

I am a hardworking undergraduate student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with a GPA of 9.0 at The Neotia University. During the course of my academic career, I also managed to accrue nearly a year of work experience. I had the privilege of working for Sidalceas Edutech as a Research Intern and at Feynn Labs as ML engineer in my free time, where I learned valuable professional skills such as project management, research and development along with some managerial skills. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as results-oriented by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular or professional projects, I have proven my technical skills which I hope to leverage into the Data Scientist role at your company.

After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive candidate you are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on how my specific skills and abilities will benefit your organisation. Please contact me at (+91) 8918151168 or via email at abhigyansen16@gmail.com to arrange for a convenient meeting time.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Abhigyan Sen
